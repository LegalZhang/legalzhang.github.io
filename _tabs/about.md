---

I am a passionate researcher and practitioner at the intersection of **Software Engineering**, **Programming Languages**, and **Large Language Models**. My work bridges theoretical foundations with practical applications, driving innovation in code intelligence and automated software development.

## Research & Expertise

### Academic Focus
- **Programming Languages**: Specializing in program analysis, static analysis, and verification techniques
- **Software Engineering**: Investigating novel approaches to improve software engineering efficiency
- **LLM4Code**: Exploring the application of large language models for cross-language, demand-driven pointer analysis and traditional program analysis.

### Current Projects
- Developing methodologies that integrate LLMs into software engineering workflows
- Researching program analysis techniques enhancement

## Industry Experience

Combining academic with practical industry insights, I focus on translating research into real-world solutions that improve tool productivity and software quality.

## Beyond Research

When I'm not immersed in code or research papers, you'll find me:
- ‚öΩ Playing football and following matches, analyzing both gameplay and team strategies
- üì∏ Capturing moments through photography, always seeking the perfect composition and storytelling
- üó£Ô∏è Engaging in debate competitions, honing my argumentation and critical thinking skills

## Connect & Collaborate
